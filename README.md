# Augmented Reality with OpenCV

This project demonstrates the implementation of a simple Augmented Reality (AR) application using Python and OpenCV. The application detects a predefined marker in a real-time video stream and overlays a custom image onto the detected marker using perspective transformations.

## Features

- **Real-Time Marker Detection**: Utilizes the SIFT feature detector to find and track a custom marker in the video stream.
- **Image Projection**: Projects a predefined image onto the detected marker using homography.
- **Robust Matching**: Employs FLANN-based matcher for efficient and robust matching of features.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What you need to install the software:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
pip install numpy
```
### Usage

To use this application, you need to provide an image of the marker and the image you want to overlay. Place these images in the project directory and specify their paths in the script. When you run the script, point your webcam at the marker to see the AR effect.

### Built With

   - **Python** - The programming language used.
   - **OpenCV** - The computer vision library used.
